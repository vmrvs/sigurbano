    <h1 class="manual" id="The_Tutorial_Your_first_Project">4 The Tutorial: Your first Project</h1>
    <p class="manual">We have mentioned already that TaskJuggler uses 
plain text files that capture the known parts of the project. As you 
will see now, the syntax of these files is easy to understand and very 
intuitive. This chapter will walk you step by step through your first 
project. You create the project plan for a made-up accounting software 
project. This project demonstrates most of the commonly used features of
 TaskJuggler. It also includes some of the more advanced concepts that 
you may or may not need for your projects. Don't get scared by them. You
 can use them once you are more familiar with TaskJuggler and your 
projects grow larger. The complete tutorial example comes with your 
TaskJuggler software installation. You can use the following command to 
find the base directory of the example projects.</p>
    <div class="manual" codesection="1"><pre class="manual" codesection="1"> ruby19 -e "puts Gem::Specification.find_by_name('taskjuggler').gem_dir"
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The file for the tutorial project is called <code class="manual">examples/Tutorial/tutorial.tjp</code>. You can use any plain text editor to view and modify it.</p>
    <h2 class="manual" id="Starting_the_project">4.1 Starting the project</h2>
    <p class="manual">Every TaskJuggler project file must start with the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/project.html">project</a>
 property. It tells TaskJuggler the name of your project and a start and
 end date. The start and end dates don't need to be exact, but must fit 
all tasks of the project. It is the time interval the TaskJuggler 
scheduler will use to fit the tasks in. So, make it large enough for all
 your tasks to fit in. But don't make it too large, because this will 
result in longer scheduling times and higher memory consumption.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">project acso "Accounting Software"  2002-01-16 +4m {
}
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">All TaskJuggler properties have a unique ID ,a 
name, and a set of optional attributes. The name must always be 
specified. The ID can be omitted if you never have to reference the 
property from another context. If you omit the ID, TaskJuggler will 
automatically generate a unique ID. The optional attributes are always 
enclosed in curly braces. If no optional attributes are specified, the 
braces can be omitted as well. In this example we will introduce a 
number of the attributes that may or may not matter for your specific 
projects. If you don't see an immediate need for a specific attribute, 
feel free to ignore it for now. You can always come back to them later. A
 full list of the supported project attributes can be found in the <i>attributes</i> section of the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/project.html">project</a> property documentation.</p>
    <p class="manual">Attributes always start with a keyword that 
identifies them. The meaning and parameters of attributes depends on the
 property context that they are used in. A context is delimited by a set
 of curly braces that enclose optional attributes of a property. The 
area outside of any property is called the global scope. Usually, 
attributes have one or more arguments. These arguments can be dates, 
character strings, numbers or symbols. Strings must be enclosed in 
single or double quotes. The argument types and meaning is explained for
 each keyword in the syntax reference section of this manual.</p>
    <p class="manual">TaskJuggler manages all events with an accuracy of
 up to 15 minutes. In many cases, you don't care about this level of 
accuracy. Nevertheless, it's good to have it when you need it. All dates
 can optionally be extended by a time. By default, TaskJuggler assumes 
that all times are UTC (world time) times. If you prefer a different 
time zone, you need to use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/timezone.html">timezone</a> attribute.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  timezone "Europe/Paris"
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">Be aware that the project start and end dates in 
the project header are specified before you specify the time zone. The 
project header dates are always assumed to be UTC unless you specify 
differently. See <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/interval2.html">interval2</a> for details.</p>
    <div class="manual" codesection="1"><pre class="manual" codesection="1">project acso "Accounting Software"  2002-01-16-0:00-+0100
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/currency.html">currency</a> attribute specifies the unit of all currency values.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  currency "USD"
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">Because each culture has its own way of specifying dates and numbers, the format for these are configurable. Use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/timeformat.html">timeformat</a>
 attribute to specify the default format for dates. This format is used 
for reports, it does not affect the way you specify dates in the project
 files. Here you always need to use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/date.html">TaskJuggler date
notation</a>.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  timeformat "%Y-%m-%d"
  numberformat "-" "" "," "." 1
  currencyformat "(" ")" "," "." 0
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">We also can specify the way numbers or currency values are shown in the reports. Use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/numberformat.html">numberformat</a> and <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/currencyformat.html">currencyformat</a> attributes for this.</p>
    <p class="manual">The attribute <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/now.html">now</a>
 is used to set the current day for the scheduler to another value than 
to the moment your invoke TaskJuggler. If this attribute is not present,
 TaskJuggler will use the current moment of time to determine where you 
are with your tasks. To get a defined result for the reports in this 
example we've picked a specific date that fits our purpose here. In your
 projects, you would use <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/now.html">now</a> to generate status reports for the date you specify.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  now 2002-03-05-13:00
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">In this tutorial we would like to compare two 
scenarios of the project. The first scenario is the one that we have 
planned. The second scenario is how it really happened. The two 
scenarios have the same task structure, but the start and end dates and 
other attributes of the task that are scenario specific may vary. In 
this example we assume that the project got delayed and use a second 
scenario that we name "Delayed" to describe the actual project. The 
scenario property is used to specify the scenarios. The delayed scenario
 is nested into the plan scenario. This tells TaskJuggler to use all 
values from the plan scenario also for the second scenario unless the 
second scenario has it's own values. This is a very easy but also 
powerful way to analyze the impact of certain changes to the plan of 
record. We'll see further below, how to specify values for a scenario 
and how to compare the results.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  scenario plan "Plan" {
    scenario delayed "Delayed"
  }
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">To summarize the above, let's look at the complete
 header again. Don't get scared by the wealth of attributes here. They 
are all optional and mostly used to illustrate the flexibility of 
TaskJuggler.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">project acso "Accounting Software"  2002-01-16 +4m {
  # Set the default time zone for the project. If not specified, UTC
  # is used.

  # Hide the clock time. Only show the date.
  timeformat "%Y-%m-%d"
  # Use US format for numbers
  numberformat "-" "" "," "." 1
  # Use US financial format for currency values. Don't show cents.
  currencyformat "(" ")" "," "." 0
  # Pick a day during the project that will be reported as 'today' in
  # the project reports. If not specified, the current day will be
  # used, but this will likely be outside of the project range, so it
  # can't be seen in the reports.
  now 2002-03-05-13:00
  # The currency for all money values is the Euro.
  currency "USD"

  # We want to compare the baseline scenario to one with a slightly
  # delayed start.

</pre></div>
    <h2 class="manual" id="Global_Attributes">4.2 Global Attributes</h2>
    <p class="manual">For this tutorial, we also like to do a simple 
profit and loss analysis of the project. We will track labor cost versus
 customer payments. To calculate the labor costs we have to specify the 
default daily costs of an employee. This can be changed for certain 
employees later, but it illustrates an important concept of TaskJuggler –
 inheritance of attributes. In order to reduce the size of the 
TaskJuggler project file to a readable minimum, properties inherit many 
attributes from their enclosing scopes. We'll see further below, what 
this actually means. Right after the project property we are at 
top-level scope, so this is the default for all following properties.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">rate 390.0
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/rate.html">rate</a>
 attribute can be used to specify the daily costs of resources. All 
subsequently declared resources will get this rate. But it can certainly
 be changed to a different rate at group or individual resource level.</p>
    <p class="manual">You may also want to tell TaskJuggler about 
holidays that affect all resources. Global holidays are time periods 
where TaskJuggler does not do any resource assignments to tasks.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">leaves holiday "Good Friday" 2002-03-29
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">Use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/leaves.html">leaves</a>
 attribute to define a global holiday. Global holidays may have a name 
and must have a date or date range. Other leaves for individual 
resources or groups of resources can be defines similarly.</p>
    <h2 class="manual" id="Macros">4.3 Macros</h2>
    <p class="manual">Macros are another TaskJuggler feature to save you
 typing work and to keep project files small and maintainable. Macros 
are text patterns that can be defined once and inserted multiple times 
in the project file. A <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/macro.html">macro</a> always has a name and the text pattern is enclosed by square brackets.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">macro allocate_developers [
  allocate dev1
  allocate dev2
  allocate dev3
]
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">To use the macro you simply have to write <code class="manual">${allocate_developers}</code> and TaskJuggler will replace the term <code class="manual">${allocate_developers}</code> with the pattern. We will use this macro further below in the example and then explain the meaning of the pattern.</p>
    <h2 class="manual" id="Declaring_Flags">4.4 Declaring Flags</h2>
    <p class="manual">A TaskJuggler feature that you will probably make 
heavy use of is flags. Once declared you can attach them to any 
property. When you generate reports of the TaskJuggler results, you can 
use the flags to filter out unwanted properties and limit the report to 
exactly those details that you want to have included.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">flags team
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">This is a <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/flags.html">flags</a>
 declaration. All flags need to be declared before they can be used to 
avoid hard to find errors due to misspelled flag names. The flags should
 be declared before any property at global scope. We will see further 
down, how we can make use of these flags.</p>
    <h2 class="manual" id="Declaring_Accounts">4.5 Declaring Accounts</h2>
    <p class="manual">The use of our resources will generate costs. For a
 profit and loss analysis, we need to balance the cost against the 
customer payments. In order not to get lost with all the various 
amounts, we declare 3 <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/account.html">accounts</a>
 to credit the amounts to. We create one account for the development 
costs, one for the documentation costs, and one for the customer 
payments.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">account cost "Project Cost" {
  account dev "Development"
  account doc "Documentation"
}
account rev "Payments"
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The account needs an ID and a name. IDs may only 
consist of the characters a to z, A to Z and the underscore. All but the
 first character may also be digits 0 to 9. The ID is necessary so that 
we can reference the property again later without having to write the 
potentially much longer name. The name may contain space characters and 
therefore has to be enclosed with single or double quotes.</p>
    <p class="manual">Accounts can be grouped by nesting them. You can 
use this feature to create sets of accounts. Such sets can then be 
balanced against each other to create a profit and loss analysis. When 
you have specified accounts in your project, you must at least define 
one default <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/balance.html">balance</a>.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">balance cost rev
</pre></div>
    <h2 class="manual" id="Declaring_Resources">4.6 Declaring Resources</h2>
    <p class="manual">While the above introduced account property is 
only needed if you want to do a P&amp;L analysis, resources are usually 
found in almost any project.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">resource boss "Paul Henry Bullock" {

}
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">This snippet of the example shows the use of the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/resource.html">
resource property</a>. Just like accounts, resources should have an ID 
and must have a name. Resource IDs, like account IDs must also be unique
 within their property class. As you can see, resource properties can be
 nested: <code class="manual">dev</code> is a group or container resource, a team that consists of three other resources.</p>
    <p class="manual">
     <code class="manual">dev1</code>, alias Paul Smith, costs more than the normal employee. So the declaration of <code class="manual">dev1</code> overwrites the inherited default rate with a higher value.</p>
    <p class="manual">The default value has been inherited from the enclosing scope, resource <code class="manual">dev</code>,
 which in turn has inherited it from the global scope. The declaration 
of the resource Klaus Müller uses another optional attribute. Attributes
 are only inherited from the parent property if the attribute was 
declared in the parent property before the child property declaration 
was started.</p>
    <p class="manual">The syntax reference lists for each property 
whether an attribute is inherited from the parent or the attribute in 
the global scope.</p>
    <p class="manual">With <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/leaves.html">leaves</a>
 you can specify certain time intervals where the resource is not 
available. Leaves are list attributes. They accumulate the declarations.
 If you want to get rid of inherited or previously assigned values, you 
can use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/purge.html">purge</a> attribute to clear the list.</p>
    <p class="manual">
     <code class="manual">leaves</code> requires a time interval. It is 
important to understand how TaskJuggler handles time intervals. 
Internally, TaskJuggler uses the number of seconds after January 1st, 
1970 to store any date. So all dates are actually stored with an 
accuracy of 1 second in UTC time. <code class="manual">2002-02-01</code>
 specifies midnight February 1st, 2002. Following the TaskJuggler 
concept of requiring as little information as necessary and extending 
the rest with sensible defaults, TaskJuggler adds the time 0:00:00 if 
nothing else has been specified. So the vacation ends on midnight 
February 5th, 2002. Well, almost. Every time you specify a time 
interval, the end date is not included in the interval. So Klaus 
Müller's vacation ends exactly at 0:00:00 on February 5th, 2002. 
February 5 is not part of the leave!</p>
    <p class="manual">Peter Murphy only works 6.4 hours a day. So we use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/limits.resource.html">limits</a> attribute to limit his daily working hours. We could also define exact working hours using the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/shift.html">shift
property</a>, but we ignore this for now.</p>
    <p class="manual">Note that we have attached the flag <code class="manual">team</code>
 after the declaration of the sub-resources to the team resources. This 
way, these flags don't get passed down to the sub-resources. If we would
 have declared the flags before the sub-resources, then they would have 
the flags attached as well.</p>
    <h2 class="manual" id="Specifying_the_Tasks">4.7 Specifying the Tasks</h2>
    <p class="manual">Let's focus on the real work now. The project 
should solve a problem: the creation of an accounting software. Because 
the job is quite complicated, we break it down into several subtasks. We
 need to do a specification, develop the software, test the software, 
and write a manual. Using the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/task.html">task property</a>, this would look as follows:</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">task AcSo "Accounting Software" {
  task spec "Specification" {
  }
  task software "Software Development" {
  }
  task test "Software testing" {
  }
  task manual "Manual" {
    journalentry 2002-02-28 "User manual completed" {
      author boss
      summary "The doc writers did a really great job to finish on time."
    }
  }
  task deliveries "Milestones" {
  }
}
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">Similar to resources, tasks are declared by using 
the task keyword followed by an ID and a name string. All TaskJuggler 
properties have their own namespaces. This means, that it is quite OK to
 have a resource and a task with the same ID. Tasks may have optional 
attributes which can be tasks again, so tasks can be nested. In contrast
 to all other TaskJuggler properties, task IDs inherit the ID of the 
enclosing task as a prefix to the ID. The full ID of the spec task is 
AcSo.spec. You need to use this absolute ID when you want to reference 
the task later on. This hierarchical name space for tasks was chosen to 
support large projects where multiple project managers may use the same 
ID in different sub tasks.</p>
    <p class="manual">To track important milestones of the project, we 
also added a task called Milestones. This task, like most of the other 
tasks will get some subtasks later on.</p>
    <p class="manual">We consider the specification task simple enough, 
so we don't have to break it into further subtasks. So let's add some 
more details to it.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  task spec "Specification" {
    effort 20d
    ${allocate_developers}
    depends !deliveries.start
  }
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/effort.html">effort</a> to complete the task is specified with 20 man-days. Alternatively we could have used the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/length.html">length</a> attribute or the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/duration.html">duration</a> attribute. <code class="manual">length</code> specifies the duration of the task in working days while <code class="manual">duration</code> specifies the duration in calendar days. Contrary to <code class="manual">effort</code>, these two don't have to have a specification of the involved resources. Since <code class="manual">effort</code>
 specifies the duration in man-days, we need to say who should be 
allocated to the task. The task won't finish before the resources could 
be allocated long enough to reach the specified effort. Tasks with <code class="manual">length</code> or <code class="manual">duration</code>
 criteria and allocated resources will last exactly as long as 
requested. Resources will be allocated only if available. It's possible 
that such a tasks ends up with no allocations at all if the resources 
are always assigned to other tasks for that period. Each task can only 
have one of the three duration criteria. Container tasks may never have a
 duration specification. They are automatically adjusted to fit all sub 
tasks.</p>
    <p class="manual">Here we use the allocate_developers macro mentioned above. The expression <code class="manual">${allocate_developers}</code> is simply expanded to</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  allocate dev1
  allocate dev2
  allocate dev3
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">If you need to <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/allocate.html">allocate</a>
 the same bunch of people to several tasks, the macro saves you some 
typing. You could have written the allocate attributes directly instead 
of using the macro. Since the allocation of multiple resources to a task
 is a good place for macro usage, we found it a good idea to use it in 
this example as well.</p>
    <p class="manual">For TaskJuggler to schedule a task, it needs to 
know either the start and end criteria of a task, or one of them and a 
duration specification. The start and end criteria can either be fixed 
dates or relative dates. Relative dates are specifications of the type <i>task B starts after task A has finished</i>.
 Or in other words, task B depends on task A. In this example the spec 
task depends on a subtasks of the deliveries task. We have not specified
 it yet, but it has the local ID <code class="manual">start</code>.</p>
    <p class="manual">To specify the dependency between the two tasks, we use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/depends.html">depends</a>
 attribute. This attribute must be followed by one or more task IDs. If 
more than one ID is specified, each ID has to be separated with a comma 
from the previous one. Task IDs can be either absolute IDs or relative 
IDs. An absolute ID of a task is the ID of this task prepended by the 
IDs of all enclosing tasks. The task IDs are separated by a dot from 
each other. The absolute ID of the specification task would be <code class="manual">AcSo.spec</code>.</p>
    <p class="manual">Relative IDs always start with one or more 
exclamation marks. Each exclamation mark moves the scope to the next 
enclosing task. So <code class="manual">!deliveries.start</code> is expanded to <code class="manual">AcSo.deliveries.start</code> since <code class="manual">AcSo</code>
 is the enclosing task of deliveries. Relative task IDs are a little bit
 confusing at first, but have a real advantage over absolute IDs. Sooner
 or later you want to move tasks around in your project and then it's a 
lot less likely that you have to fix dependency specifications of 
relative IDs.</p>
    <p class="manual">The software development task is still too complex to specify it directly. So we split it further into subtasks.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  task software "Software Development" {
    priority 1000

    <p class="manual">We use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/priority.html">priority</a>
 attribute to mark the importance of the tasks. 500 is the default 
priority of top-level tasks. Setting the priority to 1000 marks the task
 as most important task, since the possible range is 1 (not important at
 all) to 1000 (ultimately important). priority is an attribute that is 
passed down to subtasks if specified before the subtasks' declaration. 
So all subtasks of software have a priority of 1000 as well, unless they
 have their own priority definition.</p>

</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The work on the database coupling should not start before the specification has been finished. So we again use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/depends.html">depends</a>
 attribute to let TaskJuggler know about this. This time we use two 
exclamation marks for the relative ID. The first one puts us in the 
scope of the enclosing software task. The second one is to get into the 
AcSo scope that contains the spec tasks. For a change, we <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/allocate.html">allocate</a> resources directly without using a macro.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">    task gui "Graphical User Interface" {
      effort 35d
      delayed:effort 40d
      depends !database, !backend
      allocate dev2, dev3
      # Resource dev2 should only work 6 hours per day on this task.
      limits {
        dailymax 6h {
          resources dev2
        }
      }
    }
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">One more interesting thing to note is the fact that we like the resource <code class="manual">dev2</code> only to work 6 hours each day on this task, so we use the optional attribute <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/limits.resource.html">limits.resource</a> to specify this.</p>
    <p class="manual">TaskJuggler can schedule your project for two different <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/scenario.html">
scenarios</a>. We have called the first scenario <code class="manual">plan</code> scenario and the second <code class="manual">delayed</code>
 scenario. Many of the reports allow you to put the values of both 
scenarios side by side to each other, so you can compare the scenarios. 
All scenario-specific values that are not explicitly stated for the <code class="manual">delayed</code> scenario are taken from the <code class="manual">plan</code>
 scenario. So the user only has to specify the values that differ in the
 delayed scenario. The two scenarios must have the same task structure 
and the same dependencies. But the start and end dates of tasks as well 
as the duration may vary. In the example we have planned the work on the
 graphical user interface to be 35 man-days. It turned out that we 
actually needed 40 man-days. By prefixing the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/effort.html">effort</a> attribute with <code class="manual">delayed:</code>, the effort value for the <code class="manual">delayed</code> scenario can be specified.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">    task backend "Back-End Functions" {
      effort 30d
      complete 95
      depends !database
      allocate dev1, dev2
    }
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">By default, TaskJuggler assumes that all tasks are
 on schedule. Sometimes you want to generate reports that show how much 
of a task actually has been completed. TaskJuggler uses the current date
 for this, unless you have specified another date using the now 
attribute. If a task is ahead of schedule or late, this can be specified
 using the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/complete.html">complete</a>
 attribute. This specifies how many percent of the task have been 
completed up to the current date. In our case the back-end 
implementation is slightly ahead of schedule as we will see from the 
report.</p>

    }
  }
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The software testing task has been split up into 
an alpha and a beta test task. The interesting thing here is, that 
efforts can not only be specified as man-days, but also man-weeks, 
man-hours, etc. By default, TaskJuggler assumes a man-day is 8 hours, 
man-week is 40 man-hours or 5 man-days. The conversion factor can be 
changed using the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/dailyworkinghours.html">dailyworkinghours</a> attribute.</p>
    <p class="manual">Let's go back to the outermost task again. At the 
beginning of the example we stated that we want to credit all 
development work to one account with ID dev and all documentation work 
to the account doc. To achieve this, we use the attribute <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/chargeset.html">chargeset</a> to credit all tasks to the <code class="manual">dev</code> account.</p>
    <p class="manual">For the duration of the <code class="manual">AcSo</code>
 task we also have running costs for the lease on the building and the 
equipment. To compensate this, we charge a daily rate of USD 170 per day
 using the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/charge.html">charge</a> attribute.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">task AcSo "Accounting Software" {
  chargeset dev

  task spec "Specification" {
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">Since we specify the attribute for the top-level 
task before we declare any subtasks, this attribute will be inherited by
 all subtasks and their subtasks and so on. The only exception is the 
writing of the manual. We need to change the chargeset for this task 
again, as it is also a subtask of AcSo and we want to use a different 
account for it.</p>

    <h2 class="manual" id="Specifying_Milestones">4.8 Specifying Milestones</h2>
    <p class="manual">All tasks that have been discussed so far, had a 
certain duration. We did not always specify the duration explicitly, but
 we expect them to last for a certain period of time. Sometimes you just
 want to capture a certain moment in your project plan. These moments 
are usually called milestones, since they have some level of importance 
for the progress of the project.</p>
    <p class="manual">TaskJuggler has support for milestones as well. Milestones are leaf tasks that don't have a duration specification.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  task deliveries "Milestones" {
    purge chargeset
    chargeset rev

    task start "Project start" {
      start ${projectstart}
      delayed:start 2002-01-20
      charge 21000.0 onstart
    }

    task prev "Technology Preview" {
      depends !!software.backend
      charge 31000.0 onstart
      note "All '''major''' features should be usable."
    }

    task beta "Beta version" {
      depends !!test.alpha
      charge 13000.0 onstart
      note "Fully functional, may contain bugs."
    }

    task done "Ship Product to Customer" {
      # maxend 2002-04-17
      depends !!test.beta, !!manual
      charge 33000.0 onstart
      note "All priority 1 and 2 bugs must be fixed."
    }
  }
}
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">We have put all important milestones of the 
project as subtasks of the deliveries task. This way they show up nicely
 grouped in the reports. All milestones either have a dependency or a 
fixed start date. For the first milestone we have used the attribute <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/start.html">start</a>
 to set a fixed start date. All other tasks have direct or indirect 
dependencies on this task. Moving back the start date will slip the 
whole project. This has actually happened, so we use the <code class="manual">delayed:</code> prefix again to specify the start date for the delayed scenario.</p>
    <p class="manual">Every milestone is linked to a customer payment. By using the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/charge.html">charge</a> attribute we can credit the specified amount to the account associated with this task. Since we have assigned the <code class="manual">rev</code> account to the enclosing task, all milestones will use this account as well. This time, we use the keyword <code class="manual">onstart</code> to indicate that this is not a continuous charge but a one-time charge that is credited at the begin of the task.</p>
    <p class="manual">Did you notice the line in the task done that 
starts with a hash? This line is commented out. If TaskJuggler finds a 
hash, it ignores the rest of the line. This way you can include comments
 in your project. The <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/maxend.html">maxend</a>
 attribute specifies that the task should end no later than the 
specified date. This information is not used for scheduling, but only 
for checking the schedule afterwards. Since the task will end later than
 the specified date, commenting out the line would trigger a warning.</p>
    <p class="manual">Now the project has been completely specified. 
Stopping here would result in a valid TaskJuggler file that could be 
processed and scheduled. But no reports would be generated to visualize 
the results.</p>
    <h2 class="manual" id="Visualizing_the_Project">4.9 Visualizing the Project</h2>
    <p class="manual">To see and share the project data you reports can 
be generated. You can generate any number of reports and you can select 
from a variety of report types and output formats. To have a report 
generated after the project scheduling has been completed, you need 
include a report definition into the project description. Report 
definitions are properties that are very similar to the task and 
resource properties that you are already familiar with. Just like these,
 report definitions can be nested to take advantage of the attribute 
inheritance mechanism. Every report definition starts with the type of 
the report. Each type of report has a particular focus. A <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/taskreport.html">taskreport</a> lists the project data in the form of a task list. A <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/resourcereport.html">resourcereport</a> does the same in form of a resource list. For a more generic report, you can use the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/textreport.html">textreport</a>.</p>
    <p class="manual">A <code class="manual">textreport</code> does not 
directly present the data in form of a task or resource list. It just 
consists of text building blocks that are described by <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/Rich_Text_Attributes.html">Rich Text</a>. There can be a building block at the top and bottom, as well as three columns in the center. The column are called <code class="manual">left</code>, <code class="manual">center</code> and <code class="manual">right</code>.</p>
    <p class="manual">For our first report, we'll just use the center 
column for now. Like every property, you need to specify a name. This 
name will be the base name of the generated report file. Depending on 
the output format, the proper suffix is appended. For this report, we 
only chose to generate a web page in HTML format. There is no default 
format defined for reports. If the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/formats.html">formats</a> attribute is not specified, no output file will be generated for the report specification.</p>
    <p class="manual">This may seem odd at first glance since 
TaskJuggler syntax always tries to use the most compact and readable 
syntax for the common case. As you will see in a minute, reports may be 
composed of several report specifications. One report specification can 
include the output of another report specification as well. In this 
case, the included report does not need to generate it's own file. The 
output will be included within the output of another report 
specification. In case of such composed reports, the output format 
specification of the top-level format will be used for all included 
reports as well.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">textreport frame "" {
  textreport index "Overview" {
    formats html
    center '&lt;[report id="overview"]&gt;'
  }
}
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">For the main report, we choose the file name <code class="manual">Overview</code> and the format <code class="manual">html</code>. So, the generated file will be called <code class="manual">Overview.html</code>.</p>
    <p class="manual">As we've mentioned before, the sections of a <code class="manual">textreport</code>
 are defined in Rich Text format. Here we use a so called block 
generator to include the HTML output of another report definition. The <code class="manual">report</code> block generator allows us to compose reports by combining their output into a single report. You must provide the <code class="manual">id</code> parameter to specify which report definition you would like to use. In this case, it is a report definition with the ID <code class="manual">overview</code>.
 Note that generator parameters need to be enclosed in single or double 
quotes. We are essentially marking a string within a string. This can 
only work out, if we don't use the same parameter for both. Let's define
 this report first.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">taskreport overview "" {
  columns bsi { title 'WBS' },
          name, start, end, effort, cost,
          revenue, chart { ${TaskTip} }
}
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">Instead of another <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/textreport.html">textreport</a> definition we are now using a <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/taskreport.html">taskreport</a>.
 A task report contains a list of tasks in a table structure. By 
default, it contains all tasks of the project. As we will see later on, 
we can use filter expressions to limit the content to a well defined 
subset of tasks. The table contains a line for each task and comes by 
default with a few columns like the name of the task, and the start and 
end dates. For this project overview report, we like to have also the 
effort for each task, the duration, the effort, the cost and revenue 
numbers included. To top it off, we also include a column with a Gantt 
chart.</p>
    <p class="manual">By including the cost and revenue column, we are 
able to do a simple profit and loss analysis on the project. This 
P&amp;L is computed from the accounts that we have provided above. For 
this to work, we need to tell TaskJuggler which accounts are cost 
accounts and which are revenue accounts. We have already conveniently 
grouped the accounts and the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/balance.html">balance</a> attribute specifies which accounts are used for the P&amp;L in this report.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  balance cost rev
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The columns of the report can be customized. You can overwrite the default title or the cell content. See <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/columns.html">columns</a>
 for a full list of available attributes. For the chart column, we'd 
like to have a tool tip that displays additional details when the mouse 
pointer is placed over a task bar. Since we use this tool tip in several
 reports, we have defined the <code class="manual">TaskTip</code> macro for it.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">macro TaskTip [
  tooltip istask() -8&lt;-
    '''Start: ''' &lt;-query attribute='start'-&gt;
    '''End: ''' &lt;-query attribute='end'-&gt;
    ----
    '''Resources:'''

    &lt;-query attribute='resources'-&gt;
    ----
    '''Precursors: '''

    &lt;-query attribute='precursors'-&gt;
    ----
    '''Followers: '''

    &lt;-query attribute='followers'-&gt;
    -&gt;8-
]
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/tooltip.column.html">tooltip</a>
 attribute describes the content of the tool tip. The first parameter is
 a logical expression that determines when the tool tip is active. You 
can specify multiple tool tips. The first matching one is being 
displayed. The condition is evaluated for each report line. The <code class="manual">istask()</code> function only evaluates to true for task lines. See <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/functions.html">functions</a> for a complete list of functions that can be used in <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/logicalexpression.html">logical expressions</a>.</p>
    <p class="manual">The content of the tool tip is a template that uses <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/Rich_Text_Attributes.html#Block_and_Inline_Generators">query
generators</a> to include task attributes such as the start and end date.</p>
    <p class="manual">We have chosen to include the start and end date 
of each task in the report. By default, TaskJuggler lists dates as day, 
month and year. We like the format to be similar to the format that the 
project syntax uses, but also like to include the weekday. To change the
 date format, the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/timeformat.html">timeformat</a> attribute can be used.</p>
    <p class="manual">The project will last a few weeks. The most convenient unit to list efforts in is man or resource days. The <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/loadunit.html">loadunit</a>
 attribute tells TaskJuggler to list the load of each task or resource 
in man days. Since this will just be a number without a unit, it is 
advisable to include a small hint for the reader that these values are 
indeed man or resource days. The caption of the table is a convenient 
place to put this information by using the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/caption.html">caption</a> attribute.</p>
    <div class="codeframe"><pre class="code">  timeformat "%a %Y-%m-%d"
  loadunit days
  caption 'All effort values are in man days.'
</pre></div>
    <p class="manual">The <code class="manual">taskreport</code> can contain more than just the table. It is not as flexible as the <code class="manual">textreport</code>,
 but still has support for a header and footer. Let's look at the header
 first. We not only like to put a headline here, but several paragraphs 
of text. The <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/header.html">header</a> attribute is a <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/Rich_Text_Attributes.html">Rich Text</a> attribute just like <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/center.html">center</a>.
 We could enclose it in single or double quotes again. But for Strings 
that span multiple lines and potentially include single or double quotes
 as well, scissor-marks or cut-here-marks are recommended. These marks 
look like a pair of scissors that cut along a dashed line. Use <code class="manual">-8&lt;-</code> to begin a string and <code class="manual">-&gt;8-</code>
 to terminate it. The opening cut mark must be immediately followed by a
 line break. The indentation of the following line defines the 
indentation that will be ignored for all lines of the string. The 
following lines must have at least the same indentation. The indentation
 that exceeds the indentation of the first line will be kept in the 
resulting string. With this feature, you can define multi-line Rich Text
 strings without disturbing the indentation structure of your project 
file.</p>

    <p class="manual">Section headers are surrounded by <code class="manual">==</code>.
 The number of equal signs, define the section level. You need to start 
with two equal characters for the first level. Text that is surrounded 
by blank lines will create a paragraph. Bullet lists can be made by 
starting a line with a <code class="manual">#</code> character. Remember that the indentation of cut-mark strings will be ignored. Your <code class="manual">#</code>
 character must not be the first character in the line as long it is 
only preceded by the exact same number of blanks as the first line of 
the cut-mark string.</p>
    <p class="manual">If you want to reference other reports from this report, you can include the file name of this report by <code class="manual">[[</code> and <code class="manual">]]</code>.
 Don't include the extension of the file name, it will be automatically

chosen output format. For HTML output, the reference is a click-able

    <p class="manual">For the <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/manual/footer.html">footer</a>

    <p class="manual">The generated report can be found <a href="http://www.taskjuggler.org/tj3/examples/Tutorial/Overview.html" target="_top">here</a>.
 It servers as an entry page for the other reports. While it already 
contains some references, a navigator bar would be handy as well. 
Fortunately, there is a block generator called 'navigator' to take care 
of this. But before we can include the navigator in the report, we need 
to define it first.</p>

hide no reports, so all are included.</p>
